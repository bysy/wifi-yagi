# wifi-yagi
Optimized WiFi Yagi antenna. Uses the commonly available 18 AWG copper instead of 14 AWG. No tedious measuring thanks to PDF template. Wide performance band and generous construction tolerances.

Created with NEC, Haskell, and LaTeX.

## Construction notes
Print the [template](./wifiYagi.pdf) and tape the two pages together.
The centerlines should meet but not overlap.

Fabricate the driver element. It's a true loop; only the long segments are
shown in the template. Start with a piece about 2.5 times the long segment
length. Align the center of the wire with the centerline. Then bend the wire
into a square loop. The corners should be tight and smooth, not kinks. I
found bending them over the edge of a wooden table worked well. Cut off
enough excess wire so that you have a small gap in the center facing the
reflector. Solder your feed and ground to the ends of the loop. Tape it to the template.

Cut and tape the directors and reflector.

Remove excess paper and tape everything to a support sturdy enough for your
use. Try to align the centerline of the antenna with the support.

For the true *ghetto yagi* experience, use strips of cardboard. Add dummy
tape to the reverse side of the cardboard as well. It prevents warping. (A
little warping is just fine. But your usable performance manifold will be a
dogleg as well.)
